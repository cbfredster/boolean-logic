# Boolean Logic Project

A set of Boolean logic functions and SAT solvers built for coursework on propositional logic and satisfiability.

## Features

- **Pure Literal Eliminator:** Simplifies formulas by removing pure literals.  
- **DIMACS Converter:** Parses standard DIMACS CNF files.  
- **Simple SAT Solver:** Uses basic variable selection rules to search for solutions.  
- **Unit Propagator:** Applies unit clause propagation to simplify formulas.  
- **Branching SAT Solver:** Recursively explores variable assignments.  
- **DPLL Solver:** Implements the classic DPLL algorithm combining unit propagation, PL elimination, and recursive backtracking.
